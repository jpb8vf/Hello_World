# Hello_World

Description: Create a Universal iOS application in Xcode using Swift that displays "Hello World" in a label when the "Hello" button is tapped and clears the contents of the label when the "Clear" button is tapped. The label initially displays "Welcome!" when the app is first run. The project is managed in a GitHub repository.

Purpose: This challenge provides experience with building an iOS app in Xcode, creating user interfaces with interface builder, using auto layout constraints to lay out user interfaces, writing Swift code, writing code in view controllers, creating IBOutlets and IBActions, and using Git and GitHub.

Requirements:

Project Name: Hello World
Target Platform: iOS
Devices: Universal
Programming Language: Swift

This project is to be managed in a public GitHub repository. For the challenge assignment submit the Clone with HTTPS web URL for the repository with the final code committed to the master branch.

User Interface:

note: What is called a Safe Area in Xcode 9 was previously called a Layout Guide.

Place label (UILabel) 20 points down from the top Safe Area and centered horizontally. The initial content of the label is to be "Welcome!"

Place a button (UIButton) with a title of "Hello" 10 points below the label and centered horizontally.

Place a button (UIButton) with a title of "Clear" 10 points below the "Hello" button and centered horizontally.

Functionality:

When the "Hello" button is tapped, "Hello World!" is to be displayed in the label.

When the "Clear" button is tapped, the contents of the label are to be emptied.
